## Problem

You want to contribute, but aren't familiar with the Cookbook format and don't want to make an ass
of yourself.

## Solution

Take a look at an [O'Reilly Cookbook](http://shop.oreilly.com/category/series/cookbooks.do) or the
[Coffeescript Cookbook](http://coffeescriptcookbook.com/). Both of these are great examples of the Cookbook
format.

## Discussion

Cookbook-style guides contain recipes that guide a beginning programmer to a deeper knowledge of the subject
by answering specific, "how-to" style questions. Cookbook recipes address more topics than
[API documentation for a class](http://docs.emberjs.com/#doc=Ember.StateManager&src=fal), but are smaller in
scope than [a topic-based guide](http://emberjs.com/guides/view_layer/).

All recipes follow the same format: A _title_ explaining the broad topic of the recipe; a _problem statement_
that outlines the goal; a _solution statement_ that summarizes the correct approach to addressing the problem;
and a _discussion_ exploring the solution in detail. The title will often, but not always, begin with a gerund
("creating", "managing", "updating", "accessing", using", etc).

An example:

A Cookbook does not need to be read in any particular order, and each recipe should contain all the information
necessary for a beginner to address the _problem statement_. Referring to other recipes that are considered
prerequisite knowledge is encouraged.
