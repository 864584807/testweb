## Problem
You are new to Ember, but want to help write the Cookbook.

## Solution
Watch this project on Github. Github will notify you as changes are made to the project, and you may
find a place where you are able to help.

## Discussion
The first version of the Ember Cookbook will be completed in a few phases. First, we will be accepting
recipe suggestions. You can suggest a recipe by forking this repository and submitting a pull request
(see _Suggesting a Recipe_). Once we have written recipes, we'll be asking for help to proofread and test
them.

See ["Watch a project"](http://help.github.com/be-social/) on Github for information on watching projects.
